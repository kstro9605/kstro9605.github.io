        <p><strong>06/2019-Present Software Engineer</strong>
          <br><br>&#9679; Developed an automated full backup and
          recovery system for configuration files and an
          Oracle database to facilitate persistence
          between containers across releases along with a
          web application to promote accessibility
          resulting in a 87.5% time cost reduction.
          <br><br>&#9679; Partnered with a cross functional team to
          develop and present an application that acted as
          an intermediary between two systems to
          increase the value of both simultaneously
          <br><br>&#9679; Utilized Docker containers to migrate a legacy
          system in a cloud-based implementation and
          developed multiple web applications to replace
          the functionality of legacy applications for use in
          a docker container
          <br><br>&#9679; Completed assigned tasks, and provided
          additional support where needed to allow our
          program to deliver product early and surpass
          expectations, resulting in 5 consecutive years of
          perfect 5.0 CPAR scores from our government customer
          <br><br>&#9679; Created a tool used by our IA team to track,
          organize, and monitor findings for STIGs as well
          as data from cyber adjudicative meetings
          <br><br>&#9679; Performed Static Code Analysis on our legacy code base to generate reports and rectify security vulnerabilities
          <br><br>&#9679; Developed a scripting tool utilizing a JIRA API to calculate burndown metrics based on number of JIRA items and time to complete tasks
          <br><br>&#9679; Investigated and implemented a FOSS (Free Open Source Software) solution for securing a legacy code base against common vulnerabilities
          <br><br>&#9679; Analyzed and applied a FOSS solution for determining NATO country codes based on coordinates using reverse geocoding
          <br><br>&#9679; Performed bug fixing on legacy systems and developed new functionality as requested

        <p><strong>03/2018-06/2019:  Welkin Sciences, Technical Intern</strong>
          <br><br>&#9679; Developed testing software for proprietary hardware that provided live signal data comparing it to mathematically calculated values. 
          <br><br>&#9679; Performed embedded programming tasks such as introductory firmware programming with FPGAs.
          <br><br>&#9679; Conducted hardware engineering tasks including testing electric potential differences across components and soldering
          <br><br>&#9679; Wrote and reviewed project documentation.
