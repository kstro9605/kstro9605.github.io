        <p><strong>06/2019-Present Software Engineer</strong><br><br>&#9679; Investigated and implemented a FOSS solution for securing a legacy code base against common vulnerability after static code analysis revealed incidents of 
  vulnerability.<br><br>&#9679; Investigated and implemented a FOSS solution for 
  determining NATO country codes based on coordinates 
  using reverse geocoding.<br><br>&#9679; Cooperated with a separate team to develop and present 
  an application that acted as an intermediary between two 
  systems to increase the value of both simultaneously.
  <br><br>&#9679; Worked on migrating legacy systems to a cloud-based 
  implementation using Docker containers.<br><br>&#9679; Developed a web application to replace the functionality of 
  a legacy application for use in a docker container that 
  would not be able to launch a graphical interface.
        <br><br>&#9679; Modified existing script tools utilized by out IA team to 
  track, organize, and monitor findings for STIGs and 
  meetings with the customer, to accept and process 
  documents in an updated format. Developed additional 
  functionality to accept, and process different documents so 
  that the IA team is capable of updating the database more 
  effectively.
        <br><br>&#9679; Performed Static Code Analysis on Legacy code base to 
  generate reports and was able to rectify security 
  vulnerabilities found by this analysis tool
        <br><br>&#9679; Created engineering documentation describing the 
  structure and build process for the entire program code 
  base
        <br><br>&#9679; Worked on a scripting tool to pull information from a JIRA 
  system to calculate burndown metrics based on number of 
  JIRA items, and time to complete tasks
        <br><br>&#9679;Perform Bug Fixing on Legacy Systems, and develop new 
  functionality as requested. </p>
